# UNET Water Body Segmentation - PyTorch

This project contains the code for training and deploying a UNET model for water body segmentation from satellite images. The model is trained on the [Satellite Images of Water Bodies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies) from Kaggle. The model is trained using PyTorch and deployed using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

All the code for training the model and exporting to ONNX format is present in the [notebook](notebooks) folder or you can use this [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gauthamkrishnan119/water-body-segmentation-pytorch) for training the model. The [app.py](app.py) file contains the code for deploying the model using Gradio. 

## Run in Github codespace
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install -y libgl1-mesa-glx
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python app.py # follow prompt to port
- Input images should be size (256, 256)
